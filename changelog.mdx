<Update label="04/25/2025" description="Lovable 2.0">
  We’re so excited to launch **Lovable 2.0**\! This one’s all about collaboration, security, and giving you more control.

  ![Lovable Two Point Zero Pn](/images/lovable-two-point-zero.png)

  - We’ve rebranded\! New logo, brighter colors, and a much cleaner UI. Go check it out below— we hope it feels like a glow-up.
  - [Teams](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/teams): Real-time collaboration is finally here\! Invite others to co-edit apps or create shared team workspaces.
  - [**Simplified Pricing**](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/messaging-limits#free-vs-paid-plans-comparison) with two clean options: Pro starts at \$30/month and Teams starts at \$30/month.
  - **Security Scan:** Lovable now checks for vulnerabilities when you publish (if you’re connected to Supabase). This is just the beginning of our work to make vibe coding safer by default.
  - When you try to revert to a past edit after which you ran a migration, Lovable will tell you we're not reverting the Database.
  - You asked, we listened. [Chat mode](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/modes#2-chat-mode) is now _way_ smarter and **here to stay** for everyone. It doesn’t make edits, but it _can_ help you reason through problems, plan features, inspect logs, query databases, and more. Think of it as your smart, hands-off pair programming buddy.

  This is a big step forward — and we're just getting started.

  Thanks so much for being on this journey with us
</Update>

</Update>

<Update label="04/11/2025">
  - You can now purchase a domain directly from your project settings — just click “Buy a domain”, search for what you want, and complete the checkout in a few clicks. We’ve partnered with IONOS to make this possible. Read more [here](http://email.lovable.dev/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6ImRnVG1qZ29EQUotUVZKNlFWQUdXRzVfR2VPdTVlSEVGMnU1Wk5hbz0iLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9sb3ZhYmxlX2Rldi9zdGF0dXMvMTkwOTYzMzY1NjQ0MTc4NjYwOCIsImludGVybmFsIjoiZTY4ZTBhMmRhZWRkMDE5ZjkwNTQiLCJsaW5rX2lkIjoyMDk2fQ/de4d0c380fdfac4a4accea202b7884c14b49d33fc1c0ca808b5a4ebc9e6540fe).
  - Updating the favicons is now easier to set up directly from Lovable.
  - Loading larger projects should now be much faster since not all messages are loaded when the project is opened. Additional messages are loaded only when a user scrolls up.

</Update>
