Personal projects let you create and work on projects that are hidden from the rest of your workspace and only visible to you.
They are ideal for early exploration or individual experimentation. Test ideas, build prototypes, and easily share projects with your team when you’re ready to collaborate. 

To create a Personal Project, select “Personal” in the composer before starting, or go to **Settings → Project → Visibility** and set it to “Personal”. 
When you are ready to share, simply set the visibility to "Workspace" in the project settings.
