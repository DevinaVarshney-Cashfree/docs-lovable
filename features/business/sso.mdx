Single Sign-On (SSO) is available as a business feature in Lovable, enabling secure, centralized authentication across your organization. 
With SSO, users can access all their tools with one set of credentials, simplifying access management and improving security. 

Lovable supports integration with major identity providers, including Google Workspace, Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, and more. 

To enable SSO, first log in to your account and then navigate to **Settings → Workspace → Identity** and follow the setup instructions.


### Common Issues and Troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="I already have an account, but I’m joining a business workspace that uses SSO. How do I log in?">
        If you created your account using another login method (like email/password, Google, or GitHub), you’ll need to log in that way first. 
        Once you’re logged in, try logging in again using SSO. This will link your existing account to your SSO identity.
        <Note>
        **Important:** If you attempt to log in with SSO before linking your existing account, you’ll see an error. 
        This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. Log in using your original method first to complete the linking process.
