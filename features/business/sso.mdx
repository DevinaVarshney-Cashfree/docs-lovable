Single Sign-On (SSO) is available as a business feature in Lovable, enabling secure, centralized authentication across your organization. 
With SSO, users can access all their tools with one set of credentials, simplifying access management and improving security. 

Lovable supports integration with major identity providers, including Google Workspace, Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, and more. 

To enable SSO, navigate to **Settings → Workspace → Identity** and follow the setup instructions.
