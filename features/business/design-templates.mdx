Design templates help your team maintain brand consistency and streamline project creation by reusing approved designs.
Share templates across teams to ensure consistent styling, branding, and user experience, while accelerating development. 

To create a template, go to **Project → Settings** and enable “Use as template”. 

If you want to use a template, click + in the composer, and select "Use a template". Choose your desired template and create your project how you'd normally do it. 
It will automatically use design-features from the template in your project and ensure brand consistency.
