Training data exclusion is a feature for all Business Plan users, ensuring that your proprietary code, projects, and data are never used to train AI models or perform evaluations. 
This protects your sensitive information and reinforces your organizationâ€™s data privacy. 

No action is required on your end. This feature is automatically enabled for all Business Plans.
