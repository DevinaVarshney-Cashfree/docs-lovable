All our paying users can change the visibility of a project while free users default to public projects. To change the visibility of a project go to **Project settings --> Project Visibility** and choose your desired visibility. 

- **Public** projects can be viewed and remixed by anyone. A project connected to Supabase is however not remixable due to security reasons. 
- **Workspace** means it is private and only your workspace-members can access it. 
- **Personal** is a business feature that you can read about [here](/features/business/personal-projects).

<Note>
If you downgrade to a free plan, all existing workspace projects remain private to that workspace, but any **new** projects will be public.
