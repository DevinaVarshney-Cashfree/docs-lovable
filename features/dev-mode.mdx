Previously, viewing your code required connecting your Lovable project to [GitHub](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).

With Code Mode you can now view & edit the full code repository backing your Lovable project directly in the Lovable project editor.

[More on this here](https://x.com/lovable_dev/status/1895500151889768596).
