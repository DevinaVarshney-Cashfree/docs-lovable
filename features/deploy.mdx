Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

<Tip>
  Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing\!
</Tip>

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

    <Info>
      **Use previewing for iterative development**

      - Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.
      - We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.
    </Info>
    Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

    To preview:

    1. Open the **Publish** dialog.
    2. Locate the **Preview** section.
    3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

    The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.
