When you create a project, Lovable makes it easy to [publish it](../features/deploy) with the click of a button.

By default, your Lovable app is accessible via a Lovable staging subdomain (e.g., `yoursite.lovable.app`). However, you can connect your site to a custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) or a subdomain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`) that you own.

Using a custom domain enhances your brand, improves [SEO](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/seo) discoverability, and makes your site easier to find and remember.

If you want to have a custom domain, see below.

## Using Entri

To connect a custom domain, navigate to **Project \> Settings \> Domains** in Lovable.

### Requirements

- A **paid Lovable plan** is required to connect a custom domain.
- You **must own** a domain before proceeding. If you donâ€™t have one, you can purchase it from a domain provider such as:
  - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)
  - [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
  - [View full list of domain providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list)

Lovable uses [**Entri**](https://www.entri.com/) to facilitate quick and seamless domain connections.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My custom domain is connected, but my site isnâ€™t live. What should I do?">
    DNS propagation can take up to **48 hours** due to factors such as TTL (Time to Live) and internet service provider delays. If your site isnâ€™t live yet:

    - Wait a bit longer for DNS changes to fully update.
    - Use a tool like [whatsmydns](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check the status of your DNS records.
    - Clear your browser cache to ensure youâ€™re viewing the latest version of your site.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My site isnâ€™t appearing after 48 hours. What now?">
    - Double-check that your **DNS records** are correctly set in your domain providerâ€™s settings.
    - If issues persist, contact your **domain providerâ€™s support team**.
    - If your DNS settings are correct but the site still doesnâ€™t load, reach out to **Lovableâ€™s customer support** for assistance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I buy a domain through Lovable?">
    For this launch, Lovable will **not** support buying domains. We may launch domain purchasing later if these issues are resolved.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does connecting a custom domain impact my site's SEO?">
    Using a custom domain improves your site's SEO by enhancing brand credibility, allowing for better indexing by search engines, and enabling features like custom meta tags and structured data. For more SEO tips, visit [Lovable SEO Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/seo).

## Using Netlify

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain.

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Ensure that your project is successfully transferred to GitHub. In the Lovable editor, click on "Transfer to GitHub" located in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Head over to Netlify and log in using your GitHub credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    In Netlify, you'll need to follow these simple steps: Click on "Import from Git" \> Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories \> Select your Lovable repository from the provided list \> Click "Deploy"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    Let's proceed to configure your custom domain directly within Netlify: Go to "Domain Management" \> Click "Add a domain" \> Enter your domain name \> Click "Verify" \> Follow the DNS configuration prompts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5">
    Your Lovable app will automatically redeploy to Netlify whenever you make changes in Lovable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You will need to bring an existing domain or purchase one.
</Note>

## Using Vercel

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Github repository">
    Open your project in Lovable and click GitHub then "create repository" if you haven't already done so. This will commit your code to the `main` branch and create a repository. Once you do this, all changes made to code in your app will automatically be commited to your Github repository on each change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up Vercel">
    Go to the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/) and create an account. Configure your domain and set the necessary GitHub permissions (make sure to handle DNS settings properly).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic deployments">
    Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes from the `main` branch each time it is updated. You can make one or two small changes to your app on Lovable and then visit Vercel deployments to ensure updates are being redeployed from `main`. Once confirmed, do the next step:
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Development branch">
    In your GitHub repository settings in Lovable, commit all new changes to a second branch called `dev` (or whatever you want).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Vercel Builds">
    Go back to Vercel and adjust your settings to ensure it only builds production deployments from the `main` branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make changes in Development">
    Work on your app in the Lovable. Any changes will go to the `dev` branch now and wont automatically be deployed via Vercel.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f6cd18-5d12-44da-a2cf-c07687eeab44)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy new changes">
    When you're ready to push new changes to your domain, go to GitHub and perform a pull request from `dev` to `main`. Once you complete and merge the pull request, Vercel will automatically deploy the updates in about one minute.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77244d5d-f9e1-4e5b-b372-5e1ea4003d63)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Notes

- If you hit the 100/day deployment limit in Vercel (it builds your `dev` branch but doesn't deploy it). You can ask Lovable chat to build you vercel.json file which will force Vercel to not build development builds at all.

- **Supabase Consideration**: Currently, you can only utilize one Supabase instance. So, if you make extensive SQL changes, it could potentially break production. Unfortunately, we can't yet provide specific guidelines for this scenario as it's complex. Frequently test your production environment if you make changes related to Supabase.

              ls -R dist
    
          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
              publish_dir: ./dist
              cname: mysimpledomain.com
              force_orphan: true
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate GitHub Access Token">
