  <Accordion title="Custom Sitemaps for Search Engine Indexing">
    A sitemap helps search engines crawl and index your website efficiently.

    **How to Generate a Sitemap in Lovable:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Ask Lovable to **"Create a sitemap"** for your project.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 2">
        Publish/update your project.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 3">
        Submit the sitemap to **Google Search Console** under "Sitemaps" using the URL **https://[yourdomain]/sitemap.xml** (replace [yourdomain] with your custom domain). Note that if your sitemap has another name, you need to replace **sitemap.xml** in the URL with this name. This can be seen in code viewer under the public file.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 4">
        Add Sitemap: https://[yourdomain]/sitemap.xml in your robots.txt file (optional)
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    Remember to update your sitemap from time to time or make sure it is updated automatically when your website is built.

    Your sitemap will not automatically be available at https://[youdomain]/sitemap.xml once you have done this. To check your sitemap, open your command-line interface and type **"curl https://[yourdomain]/sitemap.xml"** , your sitemap should show up.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Robots.txt Configuration for Search Control">
    The `robots.txt` file tells search engines which pages they should or shouldn’t crawl. Lovable can create and customize this file for you.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Prompt Lovable with **"Generate a robots.txt file for my site."**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 2">
        Customize the file to allow or block search engines from specific pages.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 3">
        Upload it to your site’s root directory.
