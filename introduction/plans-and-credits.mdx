<Note>
  When you upgrade your plan, for example, from Pro 1 (which includes 100 credits) to Pro 2 (which includes 200 credits), you don’t get 200 new credits. Instead, your total credits for the month are updated to 200. So if you already had 100 from Pro 1, upgrading gives you 100 more, not 200 more.
</Note>

## Credit usage

Lovable has a usage-based credit system, where sending messages deducts credits. The cost of a message depends on their complexity to ensure you only pay for what you actually use. 

Many messages cost less than 1 credit, while more complex ones may cost more. 
This approach allows for more precise edits and greater efficiency per message, making Lovable more affordable overall.

Here are some example prompts and their cost:

| User Prompt                        | Work done                                                         |  Credits used      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Make the button gray               | Changes the button styles                                         | 0.50               |
| Remove the footer                  | Removes the footer component                                      | 0.90               |
| Add authentication                 | Adds login and authentication logic                               | 1.20               |
| Build a landing page with images   | Creates a landing page with generated images, a theme and sections| 2.00               |

## Credit Rollovers

Unused credits automatically roll over at the end of each billing cycle for both monthly and annual paid plans, as long as you keep an active subscription, subject to the limitations outlined below.

**Rollover credit limits:**

- **Monthly plans**: Rollover credits can accumulate up to the monthly credit limit.
- **Annual plans**: Rollover credits can accumulate up to 12 times the monthly credit limit (i.e. the annual limit).
- **Rollover credits expiration:** Rollover credits are valid up to one month after being added for monthly plans, and 12 months after being added for annual plans.
- **Downgrading**: The rollover cap decreases to the new plan’s credit limit.
- **Cancellation**: Upon cancellation of a paid subscription, all unused and rollover credits will expire at the end of the current billing period and will not carry over.

<Note>
  ### Examples:

  - If you’re on a plan with 100 credits/month, your rollover cap is 100 credits.
  - If you upgrade to a 200 credits/month plan, your new rollover cap is 200 credits.
  - If you downgrade from 200 to 100, a cap of 100 credits will roll over, even if you have more unused
</Note>

<Warning>
  Daily credits do not roll over. Unused daily credits will **not accumulate** from day to day for the free tier or for the paid tiers.
</Warning>
