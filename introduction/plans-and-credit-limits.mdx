<Note>
  Credits do not roll over. Unused credits will **not accumulate** from day to day (for the free tier) or month to month (for the paid tiers). The only exception is extra credits remaining at the end of a billing period stemming from a mid billing-cycle upgrade. These will roll over 1 month, and will be added to your account as bonus credits at the end of a billing period.
